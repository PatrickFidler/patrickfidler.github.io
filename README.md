# Hello World!
This is my personal website/portfolio. I showcase my projects, play with a few different features, and worry someone with a really bizarre screen size will break my formatting.

Utilizes Bootstrap as a frontend toolkit, D3.js for a little convenience, and is otherwise built from HTML/CSS/JS.

Take a look here (try clicking the images!): https://patrickfidler.github.io
